Hello  all,
This is my successful completion of **Task1** and **Task6** of the **GRIPFeb2021** internship at **The Sparks Foundation**.

In the first  notebook I have predicted the Scores of students students based
on their hours of study time using simple linear regression model.

In the second notebook I have created a Decision Tree classifier on the iris dataset.From there
on I have visualized the tree using graphviz and made predictions on single training example.

Hope you all find it informative.
Feel free to star this repo if found useful:)
